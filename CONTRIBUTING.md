## 📜 Ground Rules

A community like this should be **open**, **considerate** and **respectful**.

Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

* **Being open**. Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community**. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**. We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members**. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being respectful**. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## 🤝 Responsibilities

* **Ensure cross-platform compatibility** for every change that's accepted. Android and iOS.
* **Ensure that code** that goes into the repository **meets all requirements**
* **Create issues for any major changes** and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* **Don't add** any classes to the codebase **unless absolutely needed**. Err on the side of using functions.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

Atomic commits will make it easier to track down regressions. Also, it enables the ability to cherry-pick or revert a change if needed.

1. Fork it (https://github.com/hexascribe/chatbot-builder/fork)
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)

5. Create a new Pull Request
